Squamish,Pavarotti,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Pavelini,V4,2,Mark Fraser,2014,crimpy,sit-start,,,This line is found on the north face and starts seated with two crimps. Move right to the arête and then up pinches to an exciting topout| a result of the nature of the steep terrain below. Use a good spotter! 
Squamish,Pavelini,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Pavelini,V7,5,Martin Pigeon,2013,slopey,powerful,,,Start matched on an obvious sidepull undercling left of the boulder's centre. Move right through slopers and crimps to a large sidepull and up. Excellent quality in a very nice setting.
Squamish,Primer,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Pavelini,V7,2,Tim Doyle,2000,powerful,dangerous,sit-start,,Start seated below the rail. Move up to the rail and then traverse left through the overhang to an exciting topout right of the arête| which shares the same pants-filling exposure as Pavarotti.

Squamish,The Gift,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Pavelini,V6,4,Alistair King,2000,slopey,powerful,sit-start,,Start seated as for Primer| hit the rail and then finish out right as for Pavelini.
Squamish,The Gold Standard,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Liquid Gold,V3,3,,,technical,,,,Start with a poor left edge and a flat right-hand sidepull below. Chuck for the base of the cool funnel groove| match then work up and into it. Good technical press moves.
Squamish,Liquid Gold,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Liquid Gold,V4,4,,,powerful,,,,"Start with a small basalt edge and a left-hand sloper/pinch at the base of the dripping ""tongue"". Shoot way right to a better hold and then up to the lip. The roll is engaging since the landing area is quite sloping."
Squamish,Precious Metal,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Liquid Gold,V1,2,,,,,,,Pinch the overhead fin and crank to a lip jug. Not a bad warm-up| but a tad committing.
Squamish,Alcohol Abuse,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,White Slab,V1,0,Andrew Boyd,1996,slabby,,,,Slab climb near the left end of the face.
Squamish,Flying Fury,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,White Slab,V1,0,Andrew Boyd,1996,slabby,,,,Climb thin features just left of the obvious dyke feature| without using any dyke holds. Currently blocked by a fallen log.
Squamish,Dick Van Dyke,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,White Slab,V0,2,Andrew Boyd,1996,slabby,,,,Climb left to right along the narrow dyke| which sports a variety of small edges.
Squamish,Slip and Slide,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,White Slab,V4,3,Andrew Boyd,1996,slabby,,,,Paddle your way up the glassy bulge about 5 m right of the dyke. A crux lurks near the top.
Squamish,Strange Brew,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,White Slab,V2,1,Andrew Boyd,1996,slabby,,,,This final slab climb is found just to the right of Slip and Slide.
Squamish,33.33 Traverse,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,33.33 Traverse,V0,1,Erik Wolfe,2002,,,,,Start crouching| matched on the lip about 1 m right of the shelf. Traverse left to the shelf| stand on it and top out above. Very short and very easy
Squamish,Dave's Cave,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dave's Cave,V3,3,Tucker Webb,2018,dynamic,dangerous,,,This problem is nuts! Start on a small debris ledge on the slab and then leap to an obvious shelf on the lip of the huge cave. Mantel to finish. If you can't control the swing| you'll likely land upside down!
Squamish,Diretissimo,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dave's Cave,V2,2,Erik Wolfe,2002,technical,,,,Start with a right crimp flake at 2 m and a sloping left rail. Make a hard roll-up move to the left and then join Three Crescents for the slab journey above
Squamish,Three Crescents,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dave's Cave,V0+,1,Erik Wolfe,2002,technical,,,,Start with a curved lip edge and a sloper. Step onto the hanging slab and then traverse right until it's possible to work onto the upper slab and the top.
Squamish,Cave Arête,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dave's Cave,V3,3,,,,,,,Walk around the north side of the boulder to a tunnel that forms a small cave. On the east-facing wall is a small| incut rail and crimper. Start with these holds and make a tough pull to the lip. Find better holds for a tenuous roll out of the cave and onto the slabby face.
Squamish,Bullethead Dyno,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Bullethead Dyno,V2,3,,,dynamic,,,,Directly uphill from the cave is a short boulder at the wall's base. Start with a left sidepull and right sloper and jump for the lip. The flat landing helps.
Squamish,M. Gaston,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,M. Gaston,V0+,2,Erik Wolfe,2002,,,,,Start standing using a slopey left arête hold and a positive right sidepull. Work up and right along the blunt arête to a trickier-than-it-looks topout.
Squamish,Mark's Traverse,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Mark's Traverse,V0+,2,Mark Philips,1995,pumpy,,,,Starting on the far right| traverse the flat lip of the boulder leftward until it's possible to roll up just before the tree. Cool basalt bands on a lowball that climbs much longer than it first appears. 
Squamish,Dyke Rock Traverse,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dyke Rock,V3,1,Erik Wolfe,2002,sit-start,,,,Start seated using a small jug far to the right. Move left around the corner and traverse the shelf rail until it's possible to make an awkward roll.
Squamish,Dyke Direct,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Dyke Rock,V2,2,Erik Wolfe,2002,powerful,,,,Start in underclings. Paste your feet| hit the lip and finish with Dyke Rock Traverse.
Squamish,Erix Arête,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Erix Arête,V1,0,Erik Wolfe,2002,,,,,Climb the right side of the face. Start gripping the righthand arête while standing on a ledge.
Squamish,Shithook,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Red Face,V0+,1,Erik Wolfe,2002,,,,,Start crouching using edges just left of the tree. Paste your feet| hit the lip and move left to finish.
Squamish,Red Face,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Red Face,V2,3,Peter Michaux,1996,,,,,Start seated just left of the arête on a very low| small jug. Crank up and right to holds on the arête and then make a big| fun slap to the lip. Good quality on a problem that many find very stout for the grade!
Squamish,Pain Management,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Red Face,V8,2,Tim Clifford,2021,powerful,crimpy,,,Start with a small| sharp sidepull for the left hand and a sidepull undercut for the right. Pull on and make a hard move to a small edge and then up the centre of the face. Sharp and super crimpy!
Squamish,Mounting the Throne,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Red Face,V3,2,Stu Worrall,1995,reachy,,,,Start matched on a positive shelf just right of the corner of the boulder. Traverse right before making a huge reach up and right to a high| flexing edge.
Squamish,Turd Arete,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Red Face,V0+,2,,,,,,,Start as for Mounting the Throne| but move directly up to the lip and then follow it to the boulder's top
Squamish,Tin Man,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V7,0,,,dynamic,,,,Reach high to two obvious crimpers. Pull on and chuck for a good hold in the basalt blocks.
Squamish,The Fuzz,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V7,5,Nick Gibbs,2003,sit-start,,,,Start seated directly under the bulge using a small but positive left-hand sidepull and a diagonal right edge slot. Boulder up left and then back right on awesome holds. An outstanding problem on impeccable stone.
Squamish,The Fury,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V10,3,Tim Doyle,2004,crimpy,sit-start,,,Use the same start position as The Fuzz| except match the diagonal edge slot. Move with great difficulty directly up the wall to an incut crimp plate and finish above. This is a vicious| two-move power problem.
Squamish,The Furry,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V11,3,Simon Parton,2013,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start seated matched on a slopey left-facing sidepull left of The Fuzz. Climb into The Fury and finish for that problem. Most like the added length.
Squamish,The Fuzziest Fury,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V7,2,Scott Williams & Jesse Taplin,2012,reachy,crimpy,sit-start,,Start on The Fuzz. After the big left-hand move to the slopey rail reach right to the crimp on The Fury and finish for that problem.
Squamish,Van Number Five,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Fuzz,V8,2,Axel Perschmann,2010,sit-start,,,,Yet another option exists! Start on the fat sidepull as for The Furry but fire up and right to a slopey gaston (the second hold of The Fuzz). Battle your way up the wall above just left of the arête.
Squamish,Tips Crack,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,Tips Crack,V6,4,,,sit-start,,,,Hike right from the base of The Fuzz and cross a small creek to find this striking boulder. Start seated and jam the obvious crack that splits the rounded face. It's a true tips splitter| which is surprisingly rare.
Squamish,The Angry Inchworm,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Angry Inchworm,V4,3,Shelton Hatfield,2014,sit-start,,,,Start seated and jam the beautiful overhanging wide crack on the left side of the face. If you choose to bear-hug the arête on the left it reduces the grade and purity of this unique problem.
Squamish,The Well,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Well,V6,4,Matt Maddaloni,2003,powerful,,,,This boulder is partially in the creek| but the climb faces uphill. From the forest side| step into a low alcove and start from a mid-roof jug. Excellent climbing leads to the top. A good option on a hot day
Squamish,The Well Low,Grand Wall,Campground Boulders,The Well,V10,4,Tristan Salson,2019,steep,powerful,sit-start,,Start seated down and left using a lip sloper and an opposing roof hold. Make a big cross to the mid-roof jug and up from there. Worth the hike!
Squamish,Squish á Gauche,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Squish á Gauche,V0,1,Annie Tasaka,1999,sit-start,,,,Start seated under the west face matched on a small shelf just shy of the lip. Follow edges leftward around the corner and top out just left of the arête
Squamish,Squishy Low,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Squish á Gauche,V0,1,,,sit-start,,,,Start lying down matched on a smooth basalt shelf. Use a right heel-hook to lift yourself off the dirt and then punch up huge jugs. Not bad for a super lowball.
Squamish,The Little One,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Squish á Gauche,V0+,2,Dave Ferguson & Scott Norris,2001,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on a diagonal shelf on the east side of the boulder. Follow crimps rightward through the overhang until it's possible to move up to a rounded basalt jug horn on the lip. Topping out directly above the initial shelf is a fun V0.
Squamish,Shralpster,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Shralpster,V2,0,Tyrone Brett,1997,,,,,Start on the sunken face using sharp| X-shaped edges. Smear on crystals and fire to the top.
Squamish,Gravitational Pull,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Gravitational Pull,V1,1,Pam Bourdon,1999,,,,,Using edges in the middle of the face| paste your feet and chuck for the top. Short!
Squamish,Moss Candidate,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Moss Candidate,V2,2,Tyrone Brett,1997,,,,,Start on slopers on the low| right-hand end of the lip and do a semi-footless leftward traverse. Top out wherever it feels most comfortable.
Squamish,Crumbly,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Crumbly,V3,1,,,,,,,Start on the sloping nose of the overhanging prow with a heel-hook out right. Fire left to an incut and finish up the crumbly prow.
Squamish,The Cobbles,Grand Wall,Titanic South,The Cobbles,V2,2,Nick Gibbs,1996,,,,,Start with low edges and move through cobbled rock to the top. Interesting stone.
Squamish,Sea to Slab,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Sea to Slab,V7,4,Nic Lussier,2008,dangerous,,,,Start with one hand over the lip and one underneath the roof. A crazy throw and tricky mantel gain a tall| committing slab. This is a great highball with a good landing that's close to the parking lot. It's easy to shuttle pads to| which is helpful since you'll need plenty.
Squamish,Blueberry Crumble,Grand Wall,Titanic South,The Crumbles,V1,1,Ryan Davy & Nic Lussier,2007,slabby,sit-start,,,Start seated using a low| rounded hold on the right arête. Pull to a sharp edge and up.

Squamish,Timeless,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Timeless,V5,5,Jack Fieldhouse,2002,powerful,,,,This excellent line starts matched on the right-hand end of the Everyday Helmet shelf. Using a left heel-hook| move right and crank up great holds with the tree at your back. The crux is the snatch to the upper lip| which is a tad engaging if you don't have a spotter. There used to be a large log wedged between the upper part of this boulder and the tree| which forced the sequence more to the right. This version is much better.
Squamish,Timeless Low,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Timeless,V7,4,Miles Adamon,2011,reachy,powerful,sit-start,,Start sitting backwards on the boulder underneath Timeless with your left hand on a sharp flap and your right on a slopey rail. Toe-hook the starting shelf on Timeless| pull off the ground and prepare for a massive bat-hang swing while moving toward the lip. If you make it| finish up Timeless. Being tall makes this problem easier. Linking into Everyday Helmet is also V7.
Squamish,Timeless Low Low,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Timeless,V8,3,Eli Dusenbury,2013,reachy,powerful,sit-start,,Just below the Timeless Low holds is a roof jug. Start here and make two powerful moves into Timeless Low and finish for that problem. If you like roof climbing and toehooks| you'll have fun on this one
Squamish,Everyday Helmet,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Timeless,V5,4,Andrew Boyd,2006,,,,,Start on the big shelf and execute a truly demanding mantel. So simple| yet so hard!
Squamish,Chickens Flying North,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Sea to Slab,V1,0,Jack Fieldhouse,2009,dangerous,,,,Start on an undercling rail just left of Chickens Don’t Fly and traverse into Sea to Slab.
Squamish,Chickens Don't Fly,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Sea to Slab,V3,0,Jack Fieldhouse,2009,dangerous,,,,Start on a small right edge. Use foot smears to move to the arête and up. This problem has a tiered landing and a fall could have serious consequences.
Squamish,The Patriarchy,Grand Wall,Titanic South,The Patriarchy,V2,3,Stu Worrall,1996,dangerous,,,,This highball starts with positive holds in a shallow corner. Climb up and left with fast-building exposure as you move out above the tunnel entrance. A nerve-wracking highball of good quality.
Squamish,Seismic,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Seismic,V7,1,Jack Fieldhouse,1999,slopey,,,,Start on the low shelf and traverse left around the corner. Technical heel-hooks and crimpy slopers lead to the finish on Kitty Litter. High in the grade
Squamish,Kitty Litter,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Seismic,V1,1,Pam Bourdon,1999,,,,,Start with a low left arête hold and a semi-broken incut right crimp. Slap up the rounded prow until it's possible to roll up on the left. The name's a nod to the rock quality| which has improved over time.
Squamish,Stoke Up,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Stoke Up,V1,2,Tyrone Brett,1997,,,,,Climb the short| downhill-facing arête by starting on slopers around 2 m. A V2 crouch start using a lower arête hold and a positive left flake very deep in the overhang adds a couple of cool moves.
Squamish,The Pawn,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Stoke Up,V2,3,Ryan Davy,2010,sit-start,,,,Start seated compressing a left-hand sloper and a low right pinch| a very interesting feature. Using a right foot flake just above the dirt and a left heel-hook in the hole| slap to lip slopers and a tricky roll. Fun!
Squamish,The Backside,Grand Wall,Titanic South,The Patriarchy,V4,2,,,crimpy,technical             ,,,Start crouching using a pancake-shaped fingertip flake. Climb directly up the slabby face.
Squamish,Razorburn,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Razorburn,V4,4,Nick Gibbs,1996,crimpy,technical             ,,,Start with a left crimp around 1.75 m and a right crimp or thin sidepull. Tiny footholds and jagged edges gain a positive dyke hold and the top. This line is crazy sharp so wait for cold conditions! If you have any skin left| a good seated start using opposing sidepulls| Razorburn Low| pumps the grade slightly to V5.
Squamish,Font Funk,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Razorburn,V4,2,Tyrone Brett,2001,,,,,Climb the arête from a standing start using a right pinch to pull off the ground.
Squamish,Hec's Arête,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Razorburn,V7,3,Chris Hecimovic,1998,slopey,sit-start,,,Start seated using obvious slopers on the south nose of the boulder. Slap left to the sharp arête and drag your body up and onto the face. Thrutchy.

Squamish,It's About Time,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Razorburn,V5,4,Tyler Jordan,1999,powerful,sit-start,,,Start seated matched on a sloping shelf in the overhang. Use a toe or heel-hook on the arête to pull on and slap to the arête. Wrestle upward using body English. A classic that's both powerful and technical.
Squamish,One Move Blunder,Grand Wall,Titanic South,Razorburn,V4,2,Jack Fieldhouse,2004,,,,,Start matched on an obvious undercling edge. Pull on| get established and then gun for the lip and a fun mantel. Harder than it looks.

Squamish,When Harry Met Sally,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,VH,2,Harry Robertson,2003,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start on two low crimps. Boulder left the the overhang to gain Super Daddy Long Limbs and finish on that problem. Initially V12| reclimbed post-break at V13 (by Simon Parton in 2013) and now likely unclimbable after yet another break. Two variations to the original problem (links with Super Daddy Long Limbs and The Man| both by Tim Clifford) have not been repeated since the breaks and are likely no longer possible
Squamish,Super Daddy Long Limbs,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V6,4,Stu Worrall,1996,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on the smooth shelf. Boulder through the hueco to a slopey lip. Move right until it's possible to reach a flat hold and mantel out| which is a tad frightening. Pad the landing well.
Squamish,Super Daddy Long Limbs Direct,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V8,3,,,slopey,sit-start,,,Climb Super Daddy Long Limbs| but finish directly above the hueco| just right of the Sloppy Poppy topout. A classic Squamish sloper topout.
Squamish,Sloppy Poppy,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V4,5,Stu Worrall,1996,sit-start,,,,Start seated using a low| square-cut edge. Go straight up and top out on slopers. Watch the landing! Many ankles have been rolled here due to poor pad placement. Named for an infamous Seinfeld character.

Squamish,Slippery Poppy,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V2,2,,,sit-start,,,,Start as for Sloppy Poppy| but traverse left to the arête and roll around left to finish above the big tree. Not a bad warm-up for the lines to the right.

Squamish,Zero-Zero,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V10,3,Tyler Jordan,1999,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start seated in the dark| concave overhang using a small left knob| a right undercling and your feet underneath the roof. Crank to super-sharp sidepulls| a four-finger edge and finish on the jug rail above| avoiding holds on the right. Deviating from this method will reduce the grade. It's an eliminate| but a popular one that seems to suit smaller climbers with tiny fingers.
Squamish,Paralyzing,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Black Dyke,V4,3,Chris Hecimovic,1996,dynamic,,,,Start compressing a left arête hold and a right sloper. Launch for sharp jugs at the top. A seated start bumps the grade to V5 (FA Matt Lucas in 2012).

Squamish,The Words of You,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V9,2,Israel Cruces,2007,slopey,sit-start,,,Start as for Words of Me. Hit the sloper on the right| use a slopey left gaston above it and make a tough move to a small but positive hold. Avoids the left side of the scoop. A touch harder than Words of Me.
Squamish,Pat Crapped At,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V3,3,Stu Worrall,1998,slopey,,,,Start crouching with double underclings. Pull on| hit the rail and palm along it to the top.

Squamish,First of 7 Terrors,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V4,2,Matt Lucas,2008,slopey,,,,"Start as for Skin Graft| but traverse into Pat Crapped At and finish along the rail. If you're trying to tick the ""Terrors"" list| this is the the required version."
Squamish,Skin Graft,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V4,5,Jack Fieldhouse,1998,technical,,,,Start standing below the vague scoop between the arêtes.

This low start has also been linked into First of the 7 Terrors.
Squamish,Cheese Grater,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V2,4,Stu Worrall,1997,slabby,,,,Climb the slabby dihedral feature.
Squamish,Crystal Meth| Jeff?,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Cheese Grater,V5,2,Patch Hammond & Jeff Thomson,2001,slabby,,,,Climb the techy slab without the adjacent jugs. A good slab skill test.

Squamish,Wafer Thin,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Double Decker,V5,4,Nick Gibbs,1996,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start seated using small edges. Crank up and left to a tiny gaston| make a big reach to a small crimper on the slab and mantel. One Millimetre of Pain (V5)| eliminates the farthest left gaston edge.
Squamish,Wafer Decker,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Double Decker,V6,3,,,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start as for Wafer Thin| but traverse left to a low rail feature| which is the foothold for Double Decker. Finish by climbing that problem.
Squamish,Double Decker,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Double Decker,V3,5,Nick Gibbs,1996,,,,,Start with an undercling and a crimper (don't stand on the rock). Throw to the two-handed shelf and do a sketchy mantel on the right to finish.

Squamish,Snakes of Shaolin,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,World of Hurt,V10,3,Jeremy Smith,2013,crimpy,dangerous,,,This awe-inspiring highball tackles the left side of the spotted face and starts matched on a low sidepull. Hard crimp moves lead to a jug rest before an extremely high crux. This boulder was damaged significantly by the 2021 rockfall event and a large chunk on its uphill side is now missing. However| despite the shocking appearance| this problem appears to be intact. The first post-rockfall ascent will be revealing| though.
Squamish,World of Hurt,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,World of Hurt,V10,5,Jordan Wright,2008,dangerous,,,,This super high problem tackles the right side of the spotted| black face. Start standing behind the tree and climb up and left via big moves on tiny crimps. Finish through a scoop just left of the tree. Scary...

Squamish,Simone's Problem,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,White Trash,V4,0,,,dangerous,,,,Grab the lip at the north end of the tunnel and roll up onto the slab above the pit. As of winter 2021| tree debris from the summer rockfall was partially blocking access to this problem.
Squamish,White Trash,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,White Trash,V7,3,Israel Cruces,2007,technical,,,,Start matched on a small fin-like pinch on the lip. Move right and up to a difficult roll. A cool first move and an exciting topout!
Squamish,Mister Sweeper,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Bo Jo Jones,V8,2,Tim Doyle,1998,powerful,,,,Start on a low shelf under the boulder. Reach to a roof pinch and sweep to an incut at the lip. Controlling the swing can be hard| as can preventing an ankle dab against the boulder on the left.
Squamish,Bo Jo Jones,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Bo Jo Jones,V3,4,Patrick Nosil,1996,pumpy,sit-start,,,Start this excellent| steep problem seated. Traverse the lip leftward to finish on sharp jugs. A fun and pumpy traverse on generally good holds.

Squamish,Bo Jo Shelf,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Bo Jo Jones,V3,2,,,,,,,Start with a shelf on the lip and pull awkwardly onto the slab above. Not amazing.
Squamish,Bo Jo Crimp,Grand Wall,Black Dyke,Bo Jo Jones,V1,1,,,sit-start,,,,Start lying down using a long| incut edge rail way down and right of the start hold on Bo Jo Shelf. Climb up on edges. Don't use a pad to boost you off the ground at the start.

Squamish,Rocket Man Mantel,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V9,1,Andrew Boyd,2005,,,,,Approximately halfway across Rocket Man| mantel onto the face. This finish is harder.
Squamish,The Hoop Wrangler,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V5,5,Stu Worrall,1999,sit-start,,,,Start on a positive sidepull under the roof. Climb back and left to a crux lip encounter and a highball slab above. The Hoop Wrangler Low (V6| FA: Israel Cruces 2005) starts just below the sidepull matched in an undercling rail. It's physical| but dabby.
Squamish,Little Ditty,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V2,2,Stu Worrall,1996,,,,,Climb along the small corner feature from a low edge. A fun little problem.
Squamish,Big Dreams,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V7,3,Jason Kehl,2005,dangerous,,,,Start standing on a rock clutching a positive left edge on the lip of the overhang. Leap to a brick-like hold up and right| finesse the lip without venturing too far right| and then quest up the 5-m slab above

Squamish,The Rookie Low,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V9,4,Vince Chung,2002,powerful,dangerous,,,The rail that you leap for on The Rookie continues down and left into the overhang. Start with a sloping edge at 2.5 m and a small pinch just to the left. A few desperate moves lead into The Rookie.
Squamish,Shelter,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V13,5,Tim Clifford,2004,crimpy,powerful,,,Start with a high left crimp in the overhang and a small hold just below. Paste a foot| get balanced and pop to a sloping edge. A few desperate moves lead to the lip and a don't-blow-it-now roll. A very pure line that's steep| crimpy| and powerful. This problem was known as Sharma’s Cave before the addition of the non-jumping start.
Squamish,Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V1,0,Nick Goodall & Mike Doyle & Jack Fieldhouse,2001,dynamic,,,,Jump to jugs on the corner of the boulder and top out above.
Squamish,Be on Four,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V7,3,Drew Beiderwieden,2001,slopey,dangerous,,,Gain the good incut in the overhang to start (jumping used to be necessary). Move right on edges to the rail and then back left to a tricky and somewhat disconcerting finish with the large boulder below you. This cuts down on the airy nature of the original version| but creates an awkward landing situation. On the plus side| you can now brush the upper holds!
Squamish,Lesson Six,Grand Wall,The Octagon,The Octagon,V10,1,Jason Kehl,2005,slopey,dangerous,,,Start with a small right crimper just below the lip and a low| left sidepull on the rail in the overhang. Use a right heel-hook in a small slot to make a hard move to the lip| traverse left into Be On Four and finish on that problem. The cave start to this line| a long-standing project| saw the appearance of manufactured holds in 2019. This unfortunate act ruined what would otherwise have been an excellent testpiece for future climbers. Hopefully| this was an anomaly that won't occur again.

Start low on the arête with a small left-hand fin and right edge while standing on the slab. Boulder steeply up the arête above a rather disconcerting landing (bring a good spotter)! Hit slopers on the lip and up.
Squamish,Depth Perception,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Jambalaya,V2,0,Pam Bourdon,1999,,,,,Start with a left dyke pinch and a right arête hold. Traverse left and step off at a good hold.
Squamish,Back Against the Wall,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Back Against the Wall,V2,1,Pam Bourdon,1999,,,,,Start in a pit with both hands low on an obvious jug. Move left to gastons and up.
Squamish,Frank Slab,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Jambalaya,V1,1,Frank Nardi,2019,,,,,From a jug just below the arête| climb directly onto the slab above| pausing on the shelf.
Squamish,Jambalaya,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Jambalaya,V4,3,Trent Hoover,2007,,,,,From the same low jug work leftward through the overhang along the lip of the big slab.
Squamish,Under Where?,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Cacodemon,V4,2,Curtis Suave,2004,sit-start,,,,The problem is found on the right-hand wall of the tunnel that leads into the Room Service alcove. Start seated matched in a dyke scoop| traverse right to a triangular nose-shaped feature and mantel. Fun!
Squamish,Black Nails,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V11,2,Tim Doyle,2005,crimpy,,,,This line is also on the right-hand wall of the tunnel. Start matched on a sloping lip hold and move left to a small| sharp hold above the lip. Make a scary mantel and then squeeze through the gap in the blocks.
Squamish,Big Balls| Big Falls,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V3,0,Stu Worrall,1997,dangerous,,,,This pointless traverse follows the lip of The Singularity boulder from left to right.
Squamish,Room Service,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V12,4,Sean McColl,2011,powerful,,,,Either stack pads or lean off a boulder to reach a slopey sidepull rail for your right hand and a small crimpy pinch as low as possible on the arête for your left. Half a dozen brutal power moves up the overhanging prow gain the top. Bring many spotters and pads.
Squamish,Room Service Low,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V14,4,Nalle Hukkataival,2018,powerful,,,,Start with a slopey right-hand sidepull that's found at the bottom of the Room Service rail and an undercling almost directly below. Nalle had to make two trips to Squamish to get this desperate line done.
Squamish,The Singularity,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V14,5,Tim Clifford,2007,crimpy,powerful,,,This aesthetic problem| one of Squamish's hardest| is nails for the grade. Start standing with your left hand on a large shelf and your right on a pinch-like crimp above. Fire up desperate crimps and sidepulls to better holds up high. As of this writing| this problem had only seen one repeat and that was done from a start matched on the large shelf. It does not change the difficulty.
Squamish,The Corner,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,The Singularity,V11,3,Paul Nadler,2017,crimpy,technical             ,,,This ultra-thin problem tackles the gently overhanging face and arête on the right side of the wall. Start standing with a right-hand arête grip and a tiny sidepull at chest height for the left. So technical...
Squamish,ATD,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,ATD,V7,5,Stu Worrall,1999,slopey,,,,This slopey traverse is one of the very best of its kind in Squamish. Start matched on the lip out left and follow shrinking slopers rightward to a positive hold. The final mantel onto the arête is hard and airy.
Squamish,ATP,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,ATD,V3,0,Trent Hoover,2002,,,,,Do the first move of ATD| press out the lip and climb the slab to finish.
Squamish,The Ass Man,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Encore une Fois,V9,1,Jordan Wright,2001,reachy,powerful,,,Start with a sidepull on the lip above the sharp flake. Pull on and make some massive reaches rightward across the lip to better holds and the top.
Squamish,Encore Une Fois,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Encore une Fois,V11,5,Dan Gable,2001,powerful,sit-start,,,Start seated using left-facing sidepulls on the left side of the large flake in the overhang. Traverse right across the rail to the arête and then follow the lip back left to the top of Ass Man to finish. A lowball| but an incredibly good one with intricate and complex moves.
Squamish,Encore Une Fois Right,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Encore une Fois,V12,3,Tim Doyle,2007,sit-start,,,,(aka Sur le Toit) Climb Encore Une Fois to the lip| move a bit to the left and then roll up onto the face above. Adds a tough lip encounter as a final crux.
Squamish,Pushover,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Encore une Fois,V4,0,Jack Fieldhouse,2001,,,,,Start with a sidepull on the lip.
Squamish,Light Up That Doobie| Stan,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,SACP,V2,1,Nick Gibbs,1999,,,,,Reach high to an edge and mantel.
Squamish,Left SACP,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,SACP,V11,2,Tim Clifford,2009,powerful,,,,Get established on the mid-face crimp flake using poor footholds and crank up and left into Light Up That Doobie| Stan. The heel-hook flake on the left was not used to start this problem on the FA. If you use it| take V9. Middle SACP Low (V10) uses the Left SACP heel-hook start to climb into Middle SACP.
Squamish,Middle SACP,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,SACP,V9,1,Tim Doyle,2009,dynamic,,,,From the crimp flake| jump start to the slopey lip and move right to a mantel finish.
Squamish,The Initial Traverse,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,SACP,V8,1,Jack Fieldhouse,2002,slopey,,,,Start on a low shelf on the right. Make a hard lip traverse left to the blunt arête feature before desperately rolling onto the slab. Club Med (V0| FA: Pam Bourdon 2001) climbs straight up from the start.
Squamish,Chung Prow,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Chung Prow,V8,4,Vince Chung,2002,slopey,dangerous,,,Start down in the pit with right on a good rail and left underneath. Move left and reach to the upper lip| squeezed against the other boulder. Traverse directly right to the arête and up to an airy finish.
Squamish,Smack,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Chung Prow,V4,3,Jack Fieldhouse,2001,slopey,sit-start,,,This problem is located underneath Chung Prow. Start seated with a left gaston and a right pinch on the lip and move right around the corner on slopers. Hit a horn and finish either left or right.
Squamish,Over the Top,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Over the Top,V1,4,Stu Worrall,1996,powerful,,,,Start low and right on a positive hold. Reach left out the overhang to the lip and roll up. Burly.
Squamish,Finger Lickin',Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Over the Top,V3,2,Jack Fieldhouse,1999,,,,,Start in the middle of the face using low edges or sidepulls. Press up to reach a high edge and then top out above or over by the left arête.
Squamish,Rubber Ain't Stickin',Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Over the Top,V3,2,Jack Fieldhouse,1999,,,,,Climb the right arête. Start on the left face using a left edge and a right arête hold.
Squamish,Touch and Go,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Agoraphobia,V5,1,Jim Sandford,2003,dangerous,,,,Start low with your right hand on a sloping crimp on a ramp and your left on a sidepull. Move up left to a good rail and finish straight up.
Squamish,Agoraphobia,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Agoraphobia,V11,5,Tim Clifford,2004,crimpy,powerful,,,Climb out of the overhanging groove starting with a right crimp and a sharp left gaston| both around 1.75 m. A blind throw over the lip leads to a good flake and up. Excellent but sharp. It's best to wait for cold conditions or skin will be a limiting factor.
Squamish,Vapour Trail,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Agoraphobia,V6,0,Jim Sandford,2003,crimpy,dangerous,,,Start matched on a thin edge rail in the overhang. Move up and slightly left to a big| flat jug. Rest and prepare for a highball finish.
Squamish,Freeze,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Agoraphobia,V7,0,Jim Sandford,2003,crimpy,dangerous,,,Start matched on an obvious crimp. Traverse left along polished edge rails into Vapour Trails.
Squamish,Racinette Cremeuse,Grand Wall,Mantel Madness,Agoraphobia,V8,3,Gabe Zukiwski,2013,crimpy,dangerous,,,This involved line starts with a crescent-shaped feature on the right. Get to a thin edge and then move left into a powerful balance move that spans the smooth face. Continue left to finish up the high wall right of Vapour Trail on good holds. Light as a Feather (V6) links Freeze into the upper portion of this climb.
Squamish,Three Amigos,Grand Wall,Undertow,Santeria,V6,0,Moses Potter,2001,crimpy,,,,Reach to two crimps high on the face. Do a rock-over| grab a better hold and mantel.
Squamish,Last Man Standing,Grand Wall,Undertow,Santeria,V6,2,Vince Chung,2001,powerful,,,,Start on the lip just left of Santeria using a right crimp and a left sloper. Shoot up left to a sloping edge and then gun for the top of the face. This problem was V10 before one of the starting holds broke.
Squamish,Santeria,Grand Wall,Undertow,Santeria,V8,2,Israel Cruces,2001,powerful,,,,Start matched on a small plate on the lip of the roof. Pop to an edge| track right and then top out before the arête. The first move is cryptic and powerful but hitting the upper lip hold is the real crux.
Squamish,Child Abuse,Grand Wall,Undertow,Child Abuse,V4,5,Andrew Boyd,1996,dangerous,,,,Climb the left arête starting with your left hand palming the arête and your right on a low sidepull. Top out by moving around the left side of the arête over a rocky landing or by manteling direct. Child Abuse Low starts seated and bumps the grade to V6.
Squamish,Something More,Grand Wall,Undertow,Child Abuse,V6,1,Scott Williams,2006,crimpy,,,,Climb Child Abuse to the big ledge then traverse left on crimps to the back corner of the boulder. Top out on better holds over a reasonable landing.
Squamish,Lone Wolf and Cub,Grand Wall,Undertow,Child Abuse,V7,3,Tyson Braun & Jeremy Smith,2007,technical,,,,Start on Child Abuse| but move right to an arête pinch and prepare for a bizarre lunge. Success requires the technique of a samurai.
Squamish,Social Disorder,Grand Wall,Undertow,Child Abuse,V1,1,Andrew Boyd,1996,technical,,,,Layback an edge up the middle of the off-vertical face. Technical – not a bad warm-up.
Squamish,Twinkletoes,Grand Wall,Undertow,Left Foot Here,V3,0,Jack Fieldhouse,2008,slabby,,,,Traverse rightward along the angling scoop feature on the slabby face of the boulder.
Squamish,Left Foot Here,Grand Wall,Undertow,Left Foot Here,V4,3,Pierre-Olivier Beaudoin,2002,sit-start,,,,Start seated using tufa-like pinches on the bulge. Slap right to the ramp and roll up to finish. Make sure your left hand starts on the lowest pinch.
Squamish,Bed on Top,Grand Wall,Undertow,Left Foot Here,V1,0,Adam Markert,2002,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on the slopey rail. Shoot left to the lip of Left Foot Here and up.
Squamish,Undertow,Grand Wall,Undertow,Undertow,V7,5,Tim Doyle,1998,slopey,sit-start,,,"Start seated with a good edge in the overhang| make a huge reach up left to slopers and grab a good edge to top out. Did I mention ""slopers""?"
Squamish,Tough Guy,Grand Wall,Undertow,Undertow,V3,3,Tim Doyle,1999,slopey,,,,Grab the lip and crank a tough mantel. Awkward and technical – some love it!
Squamish,Underdog,Grand Wall,Undertow,Undertow,V8,3,Jordan Wright,2000,pumpy,slopey,sit-start,,Link Undertow into Tough Guy via a harder-than-it-looks traverse. Good variety of movement| but no flow whatsoever. Traversing footless is helpful.
Squamish,Underworld,Grand Wall,Undertow,Undertow,V10,2,Marco Lefebvre,2006,slopey,sit-start,,,Start matched on the diagonal Undertow foothold edge that is just below and right of the normal start hold. Use a crazy drop-knee or very technical heel-hook to make a brutal move into the start of Undertow and then finish on that problem| which you'll likely fall off of more than once. The lowest of lowballs| but surprisingly not dabby. Simon Bar Sinister (V10| FA: Jason Lee 2020) takes this into the Tough Guy mantel.
Squamish,Man Up,Grand Wall,Undertow,Man Up,V1,1,,,,,,,Start this short problem with your right hand on a rail and your left on the arête. Slap to a jug. Short| but surprisingly good value.
Squamish,Ghetto Pop Life,Grand Wall,Undertow,Ghetto Pop Life,V0-,3,,,slabby,,,,Climb the face just left of centre starting with a small left sidepull and a smaller right crimp. Hit a good rail and up. This featured face is nice for warming up.
Squamish,DJ Tatana,Grand Wall,Undertow,DJ Tatana,V0,0,Scott Tasaka,1999,,,,,Walk around the downhill nose of a long boulder and up a corridor to find a featured face. Start matched on a low arête hold and move up left on edges.
Squamish,Broken Stump,Grand Wall,Undertow,Broken Stump,V4,3,,,powerful,,,,Reach overhead to a curved flake pinch in the overhang (stack pads if necessary). Match this hold and then launch up and left to a crux lip encounter.
Squamish,Baldwin's Problem,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Squeeze,V0,2,Jim Baldwin,1961,slabby,dangerous,,,Climb the juggy| low-angle arête on the tower-shaped boulder. Coming down might be the crux! This is the oldest recorded problem in the book.
Squamish,The Squeeze,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Squeeze,V5,3,Nick Gibbs,1999,technical,,,,Start squeezing opposing pinches in the overhanging| concave face. Slap upward until it's possible to rock onto the slab creep up it to the top.
Squamish,Kareem,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Squeeze,V5,1,,,reachy,,,,This line requires the reach of an NBA pro to get off the ground. Start with your right hand pinching the arête and your left on a super high| tiny sidepull. Haul your body onto the face and then gun for a good shelf. Shorter folks might be able to use smaller holds down low.
Squamish,NBA Dreams,Grand Wall,Undertow,NBA Dreams,V2,3,,,reachy,,,,Start matched on a protruding fin jug on the short arête and make one huge move to a jug before finishing on more jugs. Shorter folks can use an intermediate ledge to navigate around the reachy business.
Squamish,Dialogue,Grand Wall,Undertow,Dialogue,V1,3,,,,,,,Climb the sharp arête on the left side of the boulder. Start in a scoop at 1.75 m.
Squamish,Pyramid Arête,Grand Wall,Undertow,Pyramid Arête,V6,3,Chris Hecimovic,1992,technical,sit-start,,,"Start seated low on the sharp left arête. A tricky sequence leads to easier moves and the top of the pyramid. This quality line has historical significance since it was likely one of the first ""modern"" problems established in the area| one that was opened with true bouldering intent. Being right on the trail to the Grand Wall| Chris had hiked by this problem on numerous occasions. One day he got psyched| bought a scrub brush and came back to clean and climb it."
Squamish,Slab Two,Grand Wall,Undertow,Pyramid Arête,V2,3,Jeff Thomson,2002,technical,slabby,,,Use technical footholds to climb the centre of the face between the arêtes| using only the tiny crystals for your hands and feet. Nice – not too high.
Squamish,Yes| You Can,Grand Wall,Undertow,Pyramid Arête,V0,2,,,slabby,,,,Climb the arête on the right side of the concave face| staying to the right. A good novice problem.
Squamish,War Tour,Grand Wall,Undertow,Pyramid Arête,V1,3,,,,,,,Face climb just right of the tree starting on obvious pair of edge holds. Fun features lead to an engaging topout| so make sure you use a pad. High in the grade.
Squamish,Unprepared,Grand Wall,Undertow,Pyramid Arête,V0+,2,Pam Bourdon,1999,,,,,Start crouching matched on a positive edge rail below the lip. Make a couple of quick moves through juggy incuts and roll over the top.

Squamish,Chips,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V5,2,Mike Chapman,2008,crimpy,,,,Start on two high edges and campus to better holds. A one-move-wonder.
Squamish,Fish,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V2,1,Mike Chapman,2008,,,,,Start on a high sloping edge. Climb either directly up or around the arête to the right.
Squamish,Eats| Shoots and Leaves,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V0,1,Hung Le,2008,,,,,"Start as for Fish| but follow a basalt dyke up the tall slab to the right. The name is borrowed from the title of a great book on the typically dry subject of punctuation. Try removing the comma in the following sentence: ""The panda eats| shoots and leaves""."
Squamish,Double Dose,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V2,1,Andrew Boyd,2008,slabby,dangerous,,,Climb the off-vertical face.
Squamish,Triple Dose,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V3,1,Andrew Boyd,2008,slabby,,,,The slippery face left of the arête.
Squamish,Eat Shiitake,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V4,4,Andrew Boyd,2008,technical,,,,Climb the arête on the left side starting with a right-hand arête pinch. Tricky footwork down low leads to an engaging mantel.
Squamish,Fender Champ,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V4,3,Andrew Boyd or Mike Chapman,2008,technical,dangerous,,,Climb the technical arête on the right side utilizing the thin| basalt dyke on the smooth face. Prepare for a spicy topout!
Squamish,Palm Meat,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V6,5,Andrew Boyd,2008,dangerous,,,,Start on the fat diagonal shelf. Boulder up the steep face on decent holds to the lip and a very tricky and frightening crux getting onto the slab. You'll earn your V points on this one.
Squamish,Smut Traverse,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V5,3,Mike Chapman,2008,pumpy,,,,Start as for Palm Meat| but follow good holds low across the face to finish on Smut. Fun
Squamish,Inca Roads,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V4,2,Andrew Boyd,2008,,,,,Do a crouching start on the V-shaped feature. Crank to the lip and top out on the right.
Squamish,Smut,Grand Wall,Undertow,Palm Meat,V2,3,Curtis Suave,2008,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on the fat shelf on the right side of the wall. The start is scrunchy and the first move is reachy| but the topout is plenty of fun.
Squamish,Long John Holmes,Grand Wall,Undertow,No Honour Among Thieves,V3,0,Tim Doyle & Andrew Boyd,1997,pumpy,,,,Traverse the low rail leftward across the massive boulder starting on a pair of positive holds. Midway across| work onto a sloping| slabby foot shelf and shuffle leftward. Gain the distant left arête and then romp up the face to the top of the boulder.
Squamish,No Honour Among Thieves,Grand Wall,Undertow,No Honour Among Thieves,V10,4,Jeremy Smith,2008,crimpy,dangerous,,,This excellent face climb starts with a positive right-hand crimp at just over 2 m and a small edge for the left down below. Climb to a pinch and then jump for a small| sharp jug. Follow better holds up and right to a high finish that feels more like a short route.
Squamish,Grand Larceny,Grand Wall,Undertow,No Honour Among Thieves,V4,0,Mike Chapman,2009,dangerous,,,,Climb the arête right of No Honour Among Thieves starting on the right side.
Squamish,No Thieves Among Us,Grand Wall,Undertow,No Honour Among Thieves,V5,0,Jack Fieldhouse,2005,sit-start,,,,Start seated with small holds near a small| sloping basalt shelf. Pull on and climb the featured face above using some very slopey crimps.

Squamish,Bear Fight Mirage,Grand Wall,Undertow,Bear Fight Mirage,V6,2,Mike Chapman,2008,crimpy,,,,Start standing with left-facing edges and climb directly up the face. Worth a look.

Squamish,Attack of the Killer Bees,Grand Wall,Undertow,Attack of the Killer Bees,V2,0,,,,,,,Start matched on a sharp| protruding shelf. Pull on| lunge for the lip and mantel.
Squamish,The Blob,Grand Wall,Undertow,Killer Tomato,V4,2,Andrew Boyd,2003,sit-start,,,,Start seated at the entrance to the small alcove matched on a slopey sidepull. Pull to a higher sidepull near the dirt and grapple over the super rounded| blobby nose of the boulder| an incredibly cool feature.
Squamish,Killer Tomato,Grand Wall,Undertow,Killer Tomato,V3,3,Andrew Boyd,2003,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on a good flake. Crank up and over the lip toward a high| slanting edge. Short| but surprisingly fun!
Squamish,Pancake Breakfast,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Snail,V7,1,Jeremy Smith & Andrew Boyd,2007,technical,crimpy,,,Start with tiny right-facing edges in a vertical seam feature. With difficulty| pull on and follow the arching seam up and left across the face to a big move| the arête and the top. A high problem that's tamed somewhat by the midface traverse.
Squamish,The Snail,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Snail,V7,2,Andrew Boyd| Jeremy Smith,2009,crimpy,dangerous,sit-start,,Start seated| matched on a small ramp hold. Nasty crimps lead up the scooped wall to a good hold| a very scary roll and a frightening 5.8 face climb to the top. This problem is huge! Make sure the upper slab is clean and then approach the climb more like a free-solo than a highball boulder problem.
Squamish,Radula Tooth,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Snail,V4,0,Mike Chapman,2009,slopey,,,,Start on a sloping shelf. Traverse right across the face and then pull the lip using seam holds.
Squamish,Muff Chest,Grand Wall,Undertow,Muff Chest,V3,3,Stu Worrall & Andrew Boyd & Tim Doyle,1997,,,,,Climb the right-leaning arête on the downhill face of the boulder from a standing start| palming and smearing the entire way.

Squamish,A Series of Unfortunate Events,Grand Wall,Undertow,A Series of Unfortunate Events,V10,4,Jeremy Smith,2018,dynamic,dangerous,,,Jump start to a large flat edge in the middle of the face. Shorter climbers may have to stack pads since the edge is quite high. Sidepull features above lead to a scoop in the upper slab and a very airy finish slightly to the right. One of the best hard highballs in town! The overhanging arête to the left of this line will produce yet another brilliant highball when complete. The feature is tall and striking and has just enough features to be workable. It's been toproped| but not bouldered.
Squamish,The Sail,Grand Wall,Undertow,The Sail,V11,3,Ben Harnden,2020,,,,,Climb along the right side of the low curved boulder| starting with a good horizontal pinch. Shorter climbers may have to stack pads to start. Name for the boulder's shape| which is wild.

Squamish,Alderaan Roof,Grand Wall,Undertow,Alderaan Roof,V2,1,Jeremy Smith & Andrew Boyd,2020,,,,,This problem is on a small boulder sitting on top of the right side of the Unfortunate Events face. Start as far back under the roof as you can and climb the short| widening roof crack to the top. 
Squamish,Stud Arête,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Stud Boulder,V0,2,,,,,,,Start crouching matched on the lowest portion of the juggy flake and climb the short face and arête just above the top of the stairs. Named for some old rivets| now removed| that were pounded into this block decades ago by the early Squamish aid climbing pioneers.
Squamish,Stud Face,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Stud Boulder,V0,1,,,,,,,Start matched on the horizontal crack right of the ledge and scramble the short| off-vertical face.
Squamish,Blasted Face,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Stud Boulder,V0-,2,,,,,,,Start with crack holds and boulder upward.
Squamish,The Alligator,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,The Alligator,V0+,2,,,,,,,Start crouching matched on the positive| scooped lip rail. Using a small right foothold in the overhang| shoot to a higher jug and then execute a rather tricky roll over the lip. Take V1 if you start seated using the two tiny crimpers just below the lip rail.
Squamish,Stupid Face,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Stupid Face,V3,1,Remy Larocque,2008,sit-start,,,,Start with sloping edges around 1.25. Awkward for the tall| but better than the name suggests.
Squamish,Bass Fishing,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V2,2,Marc Bourdon,2006,crimpy,sit-start,,,Start seated on a block in the corridor with right on the bottom of a moon-shaped sidepull and left on a small| low edge. Reach left to a basalt crimp| bump to the moon hold and gun for the ledge.

Squamish,Easy in an Easy Chair,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V4,5,Nick Gibbs,1996,slopey,,,,Squamish's most popular boulder starts on a low| twohanded ledge and traverses right on slopers to a good hold at the arête and up. The holds are slopey and the moves require some intricate heel-hooking.
Squamish,Palminator,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V4,3,Nick Gibbs,1996,powerful,,,,Start as for Easy Chair. Make one move right before reaching up and left. This is a good variation that requires lock-off strength and flexibility.
Squamish,The Elevator,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V5,2,Israel Cruces,2002,,,,,Start as for Easy Chair. Head right and mantel up the middle without using the arête hold.
Squamish,Quick Stick,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V7,1,Nick Gibbs,1996,powerful,crimpy,,,Start matched on a small incut crimp on the overhanging face and launch left for a jug on the arête. Hard and not that enjoyable. For V8 (FA: Tim Doyle 2013)| start matched on the tiny boulder underneath| reach back to a sloper| hit the Quick Stick crimp and up.
Squamish,Easy Traverse,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Easy Chair,V1,2,,,,,,,Traverse left along the top of the Easy in an Easy Chair boulder. A reasonable warm-up.

Squamish,Traverse One,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Traverse One,V1,1,,,,,,,Traverse the lip of the boulder from left to right. Finish by rolling over at the peak.

Squamish,Centre Slab,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Slab Boulder,V3,3,Nick Gibbs,1996,slabby,,,,The central slab is an excellent exercise in technical| lowangle face climbing. Don't French start! For fun| try it from a running start or without using your hands. For the latter| a chin scum at the top is key.
Squamish,Slabby,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Slab Boulder,V2,2,Nick Gibbs,1996,slabby,,,,Climb the right side of the slab without using the arête. If you use it| take V1.
Squamish,Malaria,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Malaria,V0+,1,Pam Bourdon,2000,sit-start,,,,Start seated matched on the lowest shelf and move up and left. Awkward for anyone of moderate height. This climb was cleaned on a buggy day.
Squamish,Cream Puff Dream,Grand Wall,Easy Chair,Slab Boulder,V5,3,Nick Gibbs,1996,,,,,Start with slopers at chest level. Paste your feet| throw for a good hold on the rail and move up and left to an awkward mantel. The entire grade boils down to the first move| which is very finicky.
